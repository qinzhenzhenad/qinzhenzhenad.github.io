After leaving school, the road ahead is full of unknown situations and obstacles. Thinking about it gives me butterflies in my stomach. In the last farewell party I attended, we celebrated four years of friendship over wine. When we got drunk, we cried in each other's arms. Suddenly, I felt like was losing my bosom friends. This devastated me more than I expected. Looking back on the nine years that have passed and over 3,000 days after leaving the campus, I realized that I can still meet new friends. I can still drink and talk merrily with them in my spare time. Reminiscing the poem in the farewell party nine years ago, I realized that I still have a learner’s mind. I am still filled with hope and eagerness to pursue the future, which is the most beautiful and exciting thing.</p>
      <p>毕业就是一场告别，告别同学、告别老师、告别课堂、告别校园。离开学校后，前路充满着未知与险阻，心中也有忐忑。最后的散伙饭上，和四年的知己把酒言欢，随意畅谈。酒兴之时，抱头痛哭。忽而不知谁的一句“莫愁前路无知己”，又让有点悲壮的情绪多了些期许。回头看看，九年已过，在离开了校园3000多天后，生活中依然能够遇见新的朋友，依然能够在闲暇时把酒言欢。想起九年前散伙饭上的那句诗，现在依然拥有一颗对未来充满希望和追求的初心,这是一件最美好和最有期待的事把。</p></td>

Maternal love is the greatest love in the world. My mother cared for me very much when I was young. Now that I am an adult, I can give her shelter. I remember teaching my mother how to use smartphones when they first became popular. That moment reminded me of when my mother taught me how to write as a child. When I was young, my mother taught me. When I grew up, it was my turn to teach my mother. I am very patient with my aging mother, just as she was with me when I was a child.</p>
      <p>母爱是一首写不完的诗，也是一曲唱不完的歌，犹如涓涓细流般流淌过子女的心间。母爱是人世间最伟大的爱。幼年时，母亲悉心呵护我，如今我已成年，可以换我为母亲遮风避雨。还记得，在智能手机刚开始流行时，我教母亲如何使用，那一刻让我回忆起小时候母亲教我写字的场景。小时候，母亲教导我，长大了，轮到我来教母亲。在和渐渐年老的母亲相处时，我十分有耐心，就像母亲小时候那样。</p></td>

The mountain was an extremely different world from the one below. </p>

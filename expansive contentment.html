      <td scope="col">After half a year's preparation and planning, the performance finally came to a successful end. After many trials and tribulations, I finally completed a major performance. During the six months of preparation for the performance, I stayed up all night, worked overtime, wrote countless planning schemes, and contacted hundreds of teachers and classmates. Today, the performance finally came to a perfect conclusion. Walking down the road after the end of the performance, the last half year came back to me bit by bit. Memories of my busy schedule, planning sessions, and rehearsals resurfaced in my mind. Much like a dream, I eventually woke up and it felt like the wind scattered my memories. I suddenly have a kind of &quot;lonely cloud alone go idle&quot; feeling. At the moment, it seems that all the hustle and bustle that used to fill my days suddenly came to a stop. All the waves have disappeared, and now I am back to my ordinary daily life. 经过整整半年的筹备策划，演出终于顺利结束。在历经了很多磨难后，终于忙完了一个重大演出。在筹备演出的这半年来，有熬过夜、加过班、写了无数次策划方案和联系了几百位老师和同学。今天，演出终于完美落幕。演出结束后走在路上，这半年来的点点滴滴都历历在目，忙碌、策划、预演。但又好像是一场梦，醒了就都随风飘散。我突然有一种“孤云独去闲”的感觉。此刻，似乎一切的喧哗热闹都归于平静，一切的波澜都消失不见，回归到了平凡的日常生活中。</td>

Sometimes, waves of light rise on the river, reflecting the light fog, making the vast Yangtze River look like it is filled with spirituality in an instant. I sometimes feel like the rolling river in the pursuit of my ideals. That is, I feel as if I do not know the right direction to flow. I remember making a lot of promises to myself when I graduated from college. Years later, looking back, I seem to have forgotten more and fulfilled only a handful of my promises. Looking at the river though, I realized that thousands of years of stories and characters related to the Yangtze River as this rolling river disappeared in the distance. Think about it. I cannot help but sigh in frustration and pessimism. </p>
      <p>每每乘车经过长江大桥时，我总爱眺望长江，它是那样一望无际，辽阔壮观。江面上时而泛起阵阵波光，映照着轻薄的雾气，让浩瀚的长江瞬间充满了灵性。我有时候觉得，那滚滚流淌的江水好像我的理想追求，都一样不知流向何方？我记得大学毕业时，我对自己许下诸多诺言，然而数年过去，现在回想起来，似乎忘却的远远多于实现的。但远眺这江水，千百年来和长江有关的故事和人物如同这滚滚江水般消失在远方，转念一想，不禁感叹自己的挫折和悲观又算得了什么！ </p></td>

I looked at the rain and felt extremely angry that I did not take an umbrella with me. All of a sudden, I saw a good-looking girl with a bright red umbrella coming over. I was incredibly happy. My heartbeat quickened. I desperately wanted to go and say hello to her. Although I ended up not talking to that girl, but my annoyance over the rain eventually disappeared.

It was extremely late when I arrived, and the train was about to leave. I quickly found the entrance, rushed down the stairs, and did not bother to look at the right side of the train while I was running. When I got on the train, the vehicle started to drive away. When I reached my reserved seat, I found someone else already occupying it. He was a foreigner. After a short conversation, we discovered that I was on the wrong train. This train was headed to Jinan and would not reach Tai 'an. After hearing that, I quickly went to find the conductor. She suggested that I should just get off in Jinan, and then take another train to Tai 'an. Throughout my train ride from Beijing to Jinan, I spent hours watching the scenery outside pass by and pondered about my carelessness. </p>

I then realized that it is now autumn. When the house is finished, you can buy a pot and plant a few plants inside. Put it under your bedroom window or in your study. Then, you can put a small glass jar on the windowsill and add things such as pinecones, cotton and bails. It must be nice when spring comes. 昨天去看房子的施工进度，出来时，看了一眼手表发现时间尚早，就随意走走，路过附近胡同里的一间小店，里面摆满了各种陶罐，外观质朴，工艺粗劣，我随手拿起一个，突然手上的阵阵凉意，让我意识到现在已是秋天。想着等房子装修好，可以买一个，里面种上几株绿植，把它放在卧室的窗户下面，或者放到书房。到时还要在窗台上放一个小玻璃罐子，里面插上松果、棉花、兎尾草等植物。待到春天来临，那一定很好看吧。</td>

Amid the crowd and the noise, I cannot bear to leave. </p>

      <td>Through the ages, goodbyes have always been mournful. I got along well with the students for three years, left the city, and said goodbye to them. I do not remember what year or month those happened. However, when I saw her latest photos on social media, I felt a sense of familiarity with the sunny days, green mountains and clear water. Since you and I are still enjoying this wonderful world together, such as when we are looking at a full moon, then are we truly in two different places? Although people are in two separate places, their hearts can still be together.  古往今来，送别都是如此的惆怅。朝夕相处三年的同学，离开了这个城市，再见不知是何年何月。但看到社交网络上她最近发布的照片，依旧有我熟悉的那些青山绿水艳阳天。既然你我依旧一起共赏着这大好天地，共望一轮明月，那又何曾是分别两地呢？虽人分两地，心却在一起。</td>

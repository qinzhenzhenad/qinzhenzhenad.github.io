I remember teaching my mother how to use smartphones when they first became popular. That moment reminded me of when my mother taught me how to write as a child.

I seldom had a relaxing weekend and wanted to go out to enjoy the beautiful scenery. However, I was caught in a heavy rain. On a Sunday morning, I got out of bed and opened the curtains. Looking at the rising sun, my mind and heart were overwhelmed with a &quot;lucky&quot; feeling. Basking in the warmth of the sunshine for a long time, I walked leisurely in the courtyard, enjoying the poetic feeling of &quot;birds calling out fine, penetrating into the eaves language.&quot; I did not know I could be that comfortable, but there I was enjoying such tranquillity.</p>

I then realized that it is now autumn. When the house is finished, you can buy a pot and plant a few plants inside. Put it under your bedroom window or in your study.

      <td><p>I just found out that I have insomnia, and I do not know where to start. This condition affects people more than others can imagine. I know that those who suffer from it try to present a polished reality to cover the sharp edges. Recalling some of the experiences can cause a sudden weakening of the mind and a soul-stirring sensation. I also do not have a rich life. I have a completely repetitive and boring work. That is why I inadvertently asked myself, “Is this my life”?  I suffer from sleepless nights, and the anguish in my heart is difficult to get rid of. I want to &quot;pull the knife to cut off the water&quot;, but it seems that I am more addicted to the anguish.</p>
      <p>失眠时，才发现不知从何时开始，自己过得越来越不像想象中的那样，我知道，想象中的自己已经被现实把棱角给打磨光滑了。回想起自己最近的一些心路历程，突然有一种苍白无力的感觉，没有了惊心动魄，也没有了酣畅淋漓的充实，完全就是重复枯燥的工作，不经意间反问自己一句：这难道就是我的人生吗？感觉这无眠的夜和我内心的苦闷难以排遣，想“抽刀断水”，却又彷佛更加沉溺于苦闷中无法自拔。</p></td>

      <td><p>Through the ages, goodbyes have always been mournful. I got along well with the students for three years, left the city, and said goodbye to them. I do not remember what year or month those happened. However, when I saw her latest photos on social media, I felt a sense of familiarity with the sunny days, green mountains and clear water. Since you and I are still enjoying this wonderful world together, such as when we are looking at a full moon, then are we truly in two different places? Although people are in two separate places, their hearts can still be together. </p>
      <p>古往今来，送别都是如此的惆怅。朝夕相处三年的同学，离开了这个城市，再见不知是何年何月。但看到社交网络上她最近发布的照片，依旧有我熟悉的那些青山绿水艳阳天。既然你我依旧一起共赏着这大好天地，共望一轮明月，那又何曾是分别两地呢？虽人分两地，心却在一起。</p></td>

Sometimes, waves of light rise on the river, reflecting the light fog, making the vast Yangtze River look like it is filled with spirituality in an instant. I sometimes feel like the rolling river in the pursuit of my ideals. That is, I feel as if I do not know the right direction to flow. I remember making a lot of promises to myself when I graduated from college. Years later, looking back, I seem to have forgotten more and fulfilled only a handful of my promises. Looking at the river though, I realized that thousands of years of stories and characters related to the Yangtze River as this rolling river disappeared in the distance. Think about it. I cannot help but sigh in frustration and pessimism.</p>

      <td><p>One day last week, I was resting at home and had nothing to do. So, I turned on the stereo that I had not used for a long time and played the old songs of Leslie Cheung. The moment I heard his voice, it seemed like a &quot;bird song&quot; awakened the whole house. It felt incredibly relaxed and comfortable. The song moved me to close my eyes and relish the sensation of being transported to a relaxing bamboo forest with flowing streams nearby. </p>
      <p>在上周的某一天，因休息在家无事可做，就一个人打开了好久没听的音响，放起了张国荣的老歌，在听到他声音的那一瞬间，好像一声“鸟鸣”瞬间惊醒了整个屋子。那时感觉十分放松舒适。闭上双眼，仿佛可以感受到周围满林绿竹，溪水潺流。</p></td>

      <p>每次和爱人分开的那一刻我都无比难受。最近要去美国出差，男朋友在机场送我的时候，我提着行李整个人都完全没有即将出国的喜悦和兴奋。取而代之的是对分别深深的伤感。绵软的东风好像从我的心里吹了出来，感受到的是我心中深深的无奈。</p></td>

      <p>找工作又一次失败了。此刻我的心情是无助和绝望的，感到非常压抑！这首诗里表达的情感，我十分感同身受。这空空的房子里，只有我一人。窗外似有似无的车声，但很快就再也听不见。我觉得我只能继续在绝望中孤独行走。</p></td>

When we opened the gift face to face, we looked at each other and smiled. The feeling of empathy was like that described in &quot;all the autumn waters in one colour &quot;. It is tranquil and distant. Perhaps the point of finding a mate is to find a soul you can fly with in this world.</p>
      <p>记得某一年的结婚纪念日，我和丈夫互赠了一份相同的礼物。我们两个都是周杰伦的歌迷，想不到在当天各自买了一张周杰伦的专辑互赠对方。我们面对面拆开礼物时，相视一笑，那种心意相通的感觉好像“秋水共长天一色”，恬静而悠远。也许人世间寻找伴侣的意义，就是寻找和自己能够共飞的灵魂。</p></td>

      <td><p>Every time the Spring Festival approaches and the day of family reunion comes, I am always reminded of the deep feeling of homesickness in my heart. As a native of Anhui province living in Chengdu, I have been away from home for 30 years. I remember how happy I had been when I visited my home, with all my friends and family around me. Nowadays, the graves of my grandparents are covered with weeds that grow freely. Meanwhile, my childhood playmates are scattered and drifting in different places, rarely seeing each other. With such a situation, I find it difficult to tell whether it is still my home or a foreign land. Hence, I feel my anticipation over going back to celebrate the New Year there slowly fading.</p>
      <p>近期出了几趟远差，最远的要数极其靠北的内蒙古，难得碰上个闲逸的周末，想出去欣赏下美景，却碰上了大雨，从周五傍晚开始，雨一直持续到了周六夜里，我的心情好像也跟着氤氲的空气一般，发了霉。周日早上，走出被窝，掀开窗帘，看着徐徐升起的旭日，心里头着实有点“小确幸”的感觉。沐浴在久违的阳光下，信步闲庭，感受着“鸟雀呼晴，侵晓窥檐语”般的诗意，别提有多么惬意和舒适。</p></td>

Although I feel an extreme longing for my family sometimes, I do not share those feelings and my struggles with them because I do not want them to excessively worry about me. Even though I know they were missing me just as much, I can only worry about two things.</p>
        <p>今天是工作日，我和往常一样在办公室里工作忙碌，打开电脑后就有做不完的事情。突然间停电了！之后就看见单位领导笑眯眯地走进来宣布，因停电，全体下午放假半天！听到这个消息我心中窃喜，赶紧叫上好友去看电影、喝下午茶，放松下紧绷许久的心情。整个下午，我和好友俩人嘻嘻哈哈地聊天，感觉很久都没有这样放松过了，真是偷得浮生半日闲哪！</p></td>

        <p>毕业就是一场告别，告别同学、告别老师、告别课堂、告别校园。离开学校后，前路充满着未知与险阻，心中也有忐忑。最后的散伙饭上，和四年的知己把酒言欢，随意畅谈。酒兴之时，抱头痛哭。忽而不知谁的一句“莫愁前路无知己”，又让有点悲壮的情绪多了些期许。回头看看，九年已过，在离开了校园3000多天后，生活中依然能够遇见新的朋友，依然能够在闲暇时把酒言欢。想起九年前散伙饭上的那句诗，现在依然拥有一颗对未来充满希望和追求的初心,这是一件最美好和最有期待的事把。</p></td>

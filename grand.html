Due to the pandemic, I do not need to go to work in the company for the time being. Finally, I have time to stay at home. I suddenly thought of a few dishes of menthol grass planted on the balcony, so I went over to have a look and found that its leaves have yellowed and the stem has withered. I picked up a leaf and looked at it for a long time, thinking that I was already more than 30 years old. I walked back to my room and looked in the mirror. The face in the mirror was a different person from the one I remembered when I was young.</p>
	
	<p class="p1">受疫情影响，暂时不需要去公司上班了，终于有时间待在家里。忽然想起来阳台上种的几盘薄荷草，走过去一看，发现其已经叶黄基枯了。我捡起一片叶子，看了许久，联想起自己一晃间也已经30多岁了。我走回房间照镜子，看见镜子里的面孔与那个印象中曾经年轻的我早已判若两人。</p>

I feel terrible every time I am apart from my lover . Recently, I went to the United States of America for a business trip. When my boyfriend saw me off at the airport, I did not feel the joy and excitement of going abroad. Instead, I was deeply saddened by the separation. The soft east wind seems to blow out from my heart, filling it with such deep helplessness.
	</p>
	<p class="p1">每次和爱人分开的那一刻我都无比难受。最近要去美国出差，男朋友在机场送我的时候，我提着行李整个人都完全没有即将出国的喜悦和兴奋。取而代之的是对分别深深的伤感。绵软的东风好像从我的心里吹了出来，感受到的是我心中深深的无奈。</p>

I finally embarked on this journey alone. For my graduation trip, I climbed the Yueyang Tower on my own and looked out over the Dongting Lake in front of me. What I could see was not only the horizon but also my four years of college life. I pictured those students, teachers and classes as the ripples in the lake water, which lingered in my mind.
</p>
	<p class="p1">我终于踏上了这段只有我自己一个人的旅程。作为毕业旅行，我独自登上了岳阳楼，眺望着前方的洞庭湖，望尽的是眼前的天涯路，望不尽的是我这四年的大学生活。那些同学，那些老师，那些我们一起上过的课堂，仿佛是眼前湖上的水波涟漪，在脑海中挥之不去。</p>

One day last week, I was resting at home and had nothing to do. So, I turned on the stereo that I had not used for a long time and played the old songs of Leslie Cheung. The moment I heard his voice, it seemed like a "bird song" awakened the whole house. It felt incredibly relaxed and comfortable. The song moved me to close my eyes and relish the sensation of being transported to a relaxing bamboo forest with flowing streams nearby.
</p>
	<p class="p1">在上周的某一天，因休息在家无事可做，就一个人打开了好久没听的音响，放起了张国荣的老歌，在听到他声音的那一瞬间，好像一声“鸟鸣”瞬间惊醒了整个屋子。那时感觉十分放松舒适。闭上双眼，仿佛可以感受到周围满林绿竹，溪水潺流。</p>

	 <p>Poem 诗句:</p>
	 <p>The Beautiful Lady Yu(李煜，虞美人)</p>
	 <p>If you ask me how much my sorrow has increased;Just see the over brimming river flowing east!</p>
	 <p>问君能有几多愁?恰似一江春水向东流。</p>
	 <hr class="hr2"/>
	<p>I will graduate soon. My memories and classmates will soon be part of the past. Just like the river, these will be gone forever. It is difficult to express the sadness I feel. Perhaps the feeling of separation is extremely hard because it feels like cutting people off from our lives. Therefore, we are reluctant to part ways. Spring is filled with beauty and love like the river to the east. The season comes and goes, but the only constant is that it always bring melancholy to the heart.</p>
	<p class="p1">
	我马上就要毕业了。回忆起和同学们的过往，就如同这江水一样一去不复返。这种难过的感觉实在难以表达。也许离别的感觉就是这样让人难以割断，依依不舍。美好春光和年华如大江东去，春去春又回，唯一不变的就是这始终萦绕在心头的绵绵哀愁。

		   <p>A mother's love is a poem that cannot be written. It is a song that cannot be sung. It is like a trickle of water flowing through the hearts of children. Maternal love is the greatest love in the world. My mother cared for me very much when I was young. Now that I am an adult, I can give her shelter. I remember teaching my mother how to use smartphones when they first became popular. That moment reminded me of when my mother taught me how to write as a child. When I was young, my mother taught me. When I grew up, it was my turn to teach my mother. I am very patient with my aging mother, just as she was with me when I was a child.</p>

	母爱是一首写不完的诗，也是一曲唱不完的歌，犹如涓涓细流般流淌过子女的心间。母爱是人世间最伟大的爱。幼年时，母亲悉心呵护我，如今我已成年，可以换我为母亲遮风避雨。还记得，在智能手机刚开始流行时，我教母亲如何使用，那一刻让我回忆起小时候母亲教我写字的场景。小时候，母亲教导我，长大了，轮到我来教母亲。在和渐渐年老的母亲相处时，我十分有耐心，就像母亲小时候那样。

After the rain in early autumn, the cool wind tickled my face. The mist surrounding us smelled and tasted a little sweet. Walking around the campus during this season, I felt a tinge of sadness. It seemed like there were two sets of people, the old and the new. After a rain shower, everything goes back to the way it was before. The only thing left for people to enjoy was the precious fresh autumn air.</p>
   <p class="p1">初秋的雨后,风吹拂在脸上会带来阵阵凉意,天空中夹杂着尚未蒸发的水汽,嗅在鼻子里,进入口腔中似乎还能感觉到一点点甜意。这样的季节走在校园中，不自觉地有一些些感伤，旧人去新人来。一场雨过后,一切恢复如初，,只剩下贪婪漫步的人大口深深地呼吸着这初秋最珍贵的清新氧气。</p>

At this time, flickering sunlight started to peek through the window. It seemed like it was a sign for something. I stood on the balcony to look downstairs and watched the children play hide-and-seek. They were looking for each other, but I can see them all clearly from above. Looking at this lively scene, I realized that an outsider can easily understand how things fall into place. However, they struggle to keep the balance when it comes to their own struggles in life. I cannot help but laugh at myself when I think about these things.</p>
	<p class="p1">此时窗外的阳光忽闪忽闪的，好像在预示着什么。我站在阳台看向楼下，小孩子正在捉迷藏，他们彼此寻找，我却看的清清楚楚。在这样充满生活气息的场景中，作为局外人，看的十分清楚。但当面对自己的事情时却往往进退失衡，我不禁心里这样自嘲着。</p>

	<p>	I failed again in my job search. At the moment, I feel helpless and miserable. I feel incredibly depressed. The sentiments expressed in this poem extremely resonated with me. I was alone in the empty house. There was a faint sound of cars outside the window, but even that was soon gone. I felt like I was meant to walk alone in despair.</p>
    
	<p class="p1">找工作又一次失败了。此刻我的心情是无助和绝望的，感到非常压抑！这首诗里表达的情感，我十分感同身受。这空空的房子里，只有我一人。窗外似有似无的车声，但很快就再也听不见。我觉得我只能继续在绝望中孤独行走。</p>

There is a small bookstore on campus. It is found in the corner of the earth and lined with shelves filled with a lot of new and old books. Some books had post-it notes such as those found in the economics and mathematics sections. Other books were about one's deceased father grind bo, while some were novels. There are many different categories, but all the books were put together in a messy pile. These books are forgotten even when they brought people beautiful moments like the flowers and plants. Who will care about those now?	</p>
    
	<p class="p1">校园里有一家小书店，在地上的角落和林立的书架上挤满了很多或新或旧的书，虽然旁边用便签纸贴着经济学、离散数学、考研真题、小说等诸多分类，但不同种类的书籍还是散乱的堆放在一起，这些书籍就好像是被人遗忘的花草，纵然曾经给人带来了片刻的美好，但终究被遗忘，这又有谁会在意呢。</p>

Thinking of my family, I chose to work in my hometown. Perhaps for my parents, being away from home represents a hard and uncertain future. However, it is this uncertainty that makes me yearn for the life in a big city. This kind of difference in thinking, just like "there is wood in the mountain, xi has no branches", reflects how no one else knows about the yearning of my heart.	</p>

	<p class="p1">因为考虑到家人，我终于还是选择留在家乡工作。可能对于我的父母来说，远离家乡代表着辛苦和不确定的未来，但就是这份不确定让我对大城市的生活十分向往。这种想法上的不同，就好似“山有木兮木有枝”，我的那份向往之心可能也无人知晓了。</p>

	<p>	My parents work outside the province all year round, while I study alone in school. Hence, we can only get together as a family during the annual Spring Festival. I spent many Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations alone in school. One night during the Mid-Autumn Festival, I looked up at the bright moon while walking. I had mixed feelings in my heart. My biggest wish was that my relatives, who are working far away from home, remain safe, healthy and happy. I had a strong desire to be with my relatives and share the view of this beautiful moonlight with them. I long for a reunion with my family as soon as possible.	</p>

	<p class="p1">由于父母常年在省外工作，我独自在学校读书，几乎每年只有到过年的时候才能与其相聚。在很多个中秋节里，我都是一个人在学校度过。中秋之夜，我边散步边看着天上明亮的月亮，心里面百感交集，最大的愿望就是远在他乡的亲人们能够平安健康，幸福快乐。贪恋于亲人能一起和我共享这美好的月色，早日团圆。</p>

Today, the performance finally came to a perfect conclusion. Walking down the road after the end of the performance, the last half year came back to me bit by bit. Memories of my busy schedule, planning sessions, and rehearsals resurfaced in my mind. Much like a dream, I eventually woke up and it felt like the wind scattered my memories.

I sometimes feel like the rolling river in the pursuit of my ideals. That is, I feel as if I do not know the right direction to flow. I remember making a lot of promises to myself when I graduated from college. Years later, looking back, I seem to have forgotten more and fulfilled only a handful of my promises. Looking at the river though, I realized that thousands of years of stories and characters related to the Yangtze River as this rolling river disappeared in the distance. Think about it. I cannot help but sigh in frustration and pessimism.</p>

      <td><p style="text-align: justify">Every weekend, I go online to find my favourite recipes and try to make them. Although The preparation procedures of Chinese food are complicated and the process can be tedious, I still choose to try the Chinese menu every time. Last week, I made a hot and sour soup with salt and sugar. At last, it tasted like a sunny day mixed with drizzle. It was incredibly delicious. In fact, we can learn a lot from the cooking process. The process can be extremely complicated, but we can apply this meticulousness in other aspects of our lives.</p>
      <p>每到周末，我都会特意去网上找自己喜欢的菜谱尝试做。中餐虽然程序复杂，准备工序琐碎，但每次我还是会选择中餐菜谱去尝试。上周做了一次酸辣汤，加盐又加糖，最后喝起来的感觉很像晴天之中夹杂着绵绵细雨，十分有滋味。做菜其实也是这样，乍一看工序很繁琐，但其实也是另一种细致。</p></td>

      <td><p style="text-align: justify">Yesterday, I went to see the progress of the house’s construction. I went out, looked at my watch and found out that it was still early. Hence, I decided to just take a walk. I passed by a nearby alley shop, which was filled with a variety of pots with unremarkable designs and poor workmanship. I casually picked up one and felt that it was cool in my hands. I then realized that it is now autumn. When the house is finished, you can buy a pot and plant a few plants inside. Put it under your bedroom window or in your study. Then, you can put a small glass jar on the windowsill and add things such as pinecones, cotton and bails. It must be nice when spring comes. </p>
      <p>昨天去看房子的施工进度，出来时，看了一眼手表发现时间尚早，就随意走走，路过附近胡同里的一间小店，里面摆满了各种陶罐，外观质朴，工艺粗劣，我随手拿起一个，突然手上的阵阵凉意，让我意识到现在已是秋天。想着等房子装修好，可以买一个，里面种上几株绿植，把它放在卧室的窗户下面，或者放到书房。到时还要在窗台上放一个小玻璃罐子，里面插上松果、棉花、兎尾草等植物。待到春天来临，那一定很好看吧。</p></td>

      <td>Episode 40: At 33, I am older than many college students. As I mature, I am no longer hesitant to reach out to strangers. Occasionally, I invite two to three students to play basketball with me and then part ways after the game. It seems like on top of observing the people, I established a deeper relationship with this young campus. I enjoy the youthful atmosphere, which brings back the memories of my own experiences in this campus. Although time flies and situations change, there are still some things that remain the same. 我今年三十三岁，已比许多大学生年长整整一轮。年龄的增长使我不再羞于和陌生人接触，偶尔在篮球场上邀请三两个学生，一起打打球，而后道别，仿佛除了旁观之外，和这青春校园又多了一层联系。我喜欢校园里随处洋溢着的青春气息，这让我觉得，似乎校园依然是记忆中的模样，时光飞逝，一切好像变了但也好像又没变。</td>

Although I feel an extreme longing for my family sometimes, I do not share those feelings and my struggles with them because I do not want them to excessively worry about me. Even though I know they were missing me just as much, I can only worry about two things. 最近是毕业季，一个人回家的路上，耳机里播放着喜欢的音乐，感叹自己这几年在外的留学生活，有很多的艰辛与不易，自己就像是花瓣独自飘零。有时候很想家人，但为了避免他们过多的担心，很多事情也无法告诉他们，即使知道他们也如同我一样在思念，但大概也只能“两处闲愁”了。</td>

I know that those who suffer from it try to present a polished reality to cover the sharp edges. Recalling some of the experiences can cause a sudden weakening of the mind and a soul-stirring sensation. I also do not have a rich life. I have a completely repetitive and boring work. That is why I inadvertently asked myself, “Is this my life”? I suffer from sleepless nights, and the anguish in my heart is difficult to get rid of. I want to &quot;pull the knife to cut off the water&quot;, but it seems that I am more addicted to the anguish. 失眠时，才发现不知从何时开始，自己过得越来越不像想象中的那样，我知道，想象中的自己已经被现实把棱角给打磨光滑了。回想起自己最近的一些心路历程，突然有一种苍白无力的感觉，没有了惊心动魄，也没有了酣畅淋漓的充实，完全就是重复枯燥的工作，不经意间反问自己一句：这难道就是我的人生吗？感觉这无眠的夜和我内心的苦闷难以排遣，想“抽刀断水”，却又彷佛更加沉溺于苦闷中无法自拔。</td>

After leaving school, the road ahead is full of unknown situations and obstacles. Thinking about it gives me butterflies in my stomach. In the last farewell party I attended, we celebrated four years of friendship over wine. When we got drunk, we cried in each other's arms. Suddenly, I felt like was losing my bosom friends. This devastated me more than I expected. Looking back on the nine years that have passed and over 3,000 days after leaving the campus, I realized that I can still meet new friends. I can still drink and talk merrily with them in my spare time. Reminiscing the poem in the farewell party nine years ago, I realized that I still have a learner&rsquo;s mind. I am still filled with hope and eagerness to pursue the future, which is the most beautiful and exciting thing.</span></td>

I spent many Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations alone in school. One night during the Mid-Autumn Festival, I looked up at the bright moon while walking. I had mixed feelings in my heart. My biggest wish was that my relatives, who are working far away from home, remain safe, healthy and happy. I had a strong desire to be with my relatives and share the view of this beautiful moonlight with them. I long for a reunion with my family as soon as possible. </td>

When we opened the gift face to face, we looked at each other and smiled. The feeling of empathy was like that described in &quot;all the autumn waters in one colour&quot;. It is tranquil and distant. Perhaps the point of finding a mate is to find a soul you can fly with in this world. </td>

I needed to take a connecting trip from the Beijing South Railway Station to reach my destination. It was extremely late when I arrived, and the train was about to leave. I quickly found the entrance, rushed down the stairs, and did not bother to look at the right side of the train while I was running. When I got on the train, the vehicle started to drive away. When I reached my reserved seat, I found someone else already occupying it. He was a foreigner. After a short conversation, we discovered that I was on the wrong train. This train was headed to Jinan and would not reach Tai 'an. After hearing that, I quickly went to find the conductor. She suggested that I should just get off in Jinan, and then take another train to Tai 'an. Throughout my train ride from Beijing to Jinan, I spent hours watching the scenery outside pass by and pondered about my carelessness. </td>

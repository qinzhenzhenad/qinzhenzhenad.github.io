After leaving school, the road ahead is full of unknown situations and obstacles. Thinking about it gives me butterflies in my stomach. In the last farewell party I attended, we celebrated four years of friendship over wine. When we got drunk, we cried in each other's arms. Suddenly, I felt like was losing my bosom friends. This devastated me more than I expected. Looking back on the nine years that have passed and over 3,000 days after leaving the campus, I realized that I can still meet new friends. I can still drink and talk merrily with them in my spare time. Reminiscing the poem in the farewell party nine years ago, I realized that I still have a learner’s mind. I am still filled with hope and eagerness to pursue the future, which is the most beautiful and exciting thing.</p>
      <p>毕业就是一场告别，告别同学、告别老师、告别课堂、告别校园。离开学校后，前路充满着未知与险阻，心中也有忐忑。最后的散伙饭上，和四年的知己把酒言欢，随意畅谈。酒兴之时，抱头痛哭。忽而不知谁的一句“莫愁前路无知己”，又让有点悲壮的情绪多了些期许。回头看看，九年已过，在离开了校园3000多天后，生活中依然能够遇见新的朋友，依然能够在闲暇时把酒言欢。想起九年前散伙饭上的那句诗，现在依然拥有一颗对未来充满希望和追求的初心,这是一件最美好和最有期待的事把。</p></td>

I needed to take a connecting trip from the Beijing South Railway Station to reach my destination. It was extremely late when I arrived, and the train was about to leave. I quickly found the entrance, rushed down the stairs, and did not bother to look at the right side of the train while I was running. When I got on the train, the vehicle started to drive away. When I reached my reserved seat, I found someone else already occupying it. He was a foreigner. After a short conversation, we discovered that I was on the wrong train. This train was headed to Jinan and would not reach Tai 'an. After hearing that, I quickly went to find the conductor. She suggested that I should just get off in Jinan, and then take another train to Tai 'an. Throughout my train ride from Beijing to Jinan, I spent hours watching the scenery outside pass by and pondered about my carelessness. </p>
      <p>大约是在2011年，有一次被公司派往山东泰安出差，需要到达北京南站再转车。当时到达的时间已经很晚了，车马上就要开了。于是飞速找到进站口，下楼梯，看也没看就朝向右边的列车狂奔。上车后，车就开了，找到票上对应的座位却发现有人，而且是一个外国友人，与其简单聊了一下，才发现是自己上错了车。原来，这趟车是到济南不能到达泰安，听到之后赶忙去找了列车长，她建议在济南下车，然后再从济南乘坐列车到泰安。从北京到济南的这几个小时，在列车上看着车外的风景飞驰而过，想想也觉得自己是多么的大意。</p></td>

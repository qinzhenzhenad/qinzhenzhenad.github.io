I cannot help but laugh at myself when I think about these things. </p>

      <td>《苏轼，水调歌头》人有悲欢离合，月有阴晴圆缺，此事古难全。但愿人长久，千里共婵娟.&lt;The Midautumn Festival Tune: &quot;Prelude to Water Melody&quot;&gt; Men have sorrow and joy; they part or meet again;The moon is bright or dim and she may wax or wane.There has been nothing perfect since the olden days.So let us wish that man Will live long as he can!Though miles apart, we’ll share the beauty she displays.(Xu Yuanchong)</td>

      <td><p>My parents work outside the province all year round, while I study alone in school. Hence, we can only get together as a family during the annual Spring Festival. I spent many Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations alone in school. One night during the Mid-Autumn Festival, I looked up at the bright moon while walking. I had mixed feelings in my heart. My biggest wish was that my relatives, who are working far away from home, remain safe, healthy and happy. I had a strong desire to be with my relatives and share the view of this beautiful moonlight with them. I long for a reunion with my family as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>由于父母常年在省外工作，我独自在学校读书，几乎每年只有到过年的时候才能与其相聚。在很多个中秋节里，我都是一个人在学校度过。中秋之夜，我边散步边看着天上明亮的月亮，心里面百感交集，最大的愿望就是远在他乡的亲人们能够平安健康，幸福快乐。贪恋于亲人能一起和我共享这美好的月色，早日团圆。</p></td>

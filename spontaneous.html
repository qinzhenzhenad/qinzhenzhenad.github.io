      <td scope="col"><p>Graduation is a farewell. It is a farewell to my classmates, teachers, classes, and the campus. After leaving school, the road ahead is full of unknown situations and obstacles. Thinking about it gives me butterflies in my stomach. In the last farewell party I attended, we celebrated four years of friendship over wine. When we got drunk, we cried in each other's arms. Suddenly, I felt like was losing my bosom friends. This devastated me more than I expected. Looking back on the nine years that have passed and over 3,000 days after leaving the campus, I realized that I can still meet new friends. I can still drink and talk merrily with them in my spare time. Reminiscing the poem in the farewell party nine years ago, I realized that I still have a learner’s mind. I am still filled with hope and eagerness to pursue the future, which is the most beautiful and exciting thing.</p>
      <p>毕业就是一场告别，告别同学、告别老师、告别课堂、告别校园。离开学校后，前路充满着未知与险阻，心中也有忐忑。最后的散伙饭上，和四年的知己把酒言欢，随意畅谈。酒兴之时，抱头痛哭。忽而不知谁的一句“莫愁前路无知己”，又让有点悲壮的情绪多了些期许。回头看看，九年已过，在离开了校园3000多天后，生活中依然能够遇见新的朋友，依然能够在闲暇时把酒言欢。想起九年前散伙饭上的那句诗，现在依然拥有一颗对未来充满希望和追求的初心,这是一件最美好和最有期待的事把。</p></td>

Maternal love is the greatest love in the world. My mother cared for me very much when I was young. Now that I am an adult, I can give her shelter. I remember teaching my mother how to use smartphones when they first became popular. That moment reminded me of when my mother taught me how to write as a child. When I was young, my mother taught me. When I grew up, it was my turn to teach my mother. I am very patient with my aging mother, just as she was with me when I was a child.</p>

      <td><p>Sometime in 2011, my company sent me on a business trip to Tai 'an in Shandong. I needed to take a connecting trip from the Beijing South Railway Station to reach my destination. It was extremely late when I arrived, and the train was about to leave. I quickly found the entrance, rushed down the stairs, and did not bother to look at the right side of the train while I was running. When I got on the train, the vehicle started to drive away. When I reached my reserved seat, I found someone else already occupying it. He was a foreigner. After a short conversation, we discovered that I was on the wrong train. This train was headed to Jinan and would not reach Tai 'an. After hearing that, I quickly went to find the conductor. She suggested that I should just get off in Jinan, and then take another train to Tai 'an. Throughout my train ride from Beijing to Jinan, I spent hours watching the scenery outside pass by and pondered about my carelessness. </p>
      <p>大约是在2011年，有一次被公司派往山东泰安出差，需要到达北京南站再转车。当时到达的时间已经很晚了，车马上就要开了。于是飞速找到进站口，下楼梯，看也没看就朝向右边的列车狂奔。上车后，车就开了，找到票上对应的座位却发现有人，而且是一个外国友人，与其简单聊了一下，才发现是自己上错了车。原来，这趟车是到济南不能到达泰安，听到之后赶忙去找了列车长，她建议在济南下车，然后再从济南乘坐列车到泰安。从北京到济南的这几个小时，在列车上看着车外的风景飞驰而过，想想也觉得自己是多么的大意。</p></td>

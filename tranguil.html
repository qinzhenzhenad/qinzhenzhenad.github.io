      <td><p>After half a year's preparation and planning, the performance finally came to a successful end. After many trials and tribulations, I finally completed a major performance. During the six months of preparation for the performance, I stayed up all night, worked overtime, wrote countless planning schemes, and contacted hundreds of teachers and classmates. Today, the performance finally came to a perfect conclusion. Walking down the road after the end of the performance, the last half year came back to me bit by bit. Memories of my busy schedule, planning sessions, and rehearsals resurfaced in my mind. Much like a dream, I eventually woke up and it felt like the wind scattered my memories. I suddenly have a kind of &quot;lonely cloud alone go idle&quot; feeling. At the moment, it seems that all the hustle and bustle that used to fill my days suddenly came to a stop. All the waves have disappeared, and now I am back to my ordinary daily life. </p>

      <td><p>Every time the Spring Festival approaches and the day of family reunion comes, I am always reminded of the deep feeling of homesickness in my heart. As a native of Anhui province living in Chengdu, I have been away from home for 30 years. I remember how happy I had been when I visited my home, with all my friends and family around me. Nowadays, the graves of my grandparents are covered with weeds that grow freely. Meanwhile, my childhood playmates are scattered and drifting in different places, rarely seeing each other. With such a situation, I find it difficult to tell whether it is still my home or a foreign land. Hence, I feel my anticipation over going back to celebrate the New Year there slowly fading. </p>
      <p>每当临近春节，到了家人团聚的日子，总会勾起我内心浓浓的思乡之情。作为一个生活在成都的安徽人，算起来我离开家乡已经有30年了。想起我刚离家回来时，亲朋好友都在身边，多么一副其乐融融的景象。如今，爷爷奶奶的坟头已经长满了肆意生长的杂草，儿时的玩伴也多分散漂泊在各地，很难能见到面。这样的状况，一时间究竟是家乡还是异乡似乎也难以分清，就这样过年回家的期盼慢慢淡了。</p></td>

      <td><p>One morning, I had a minor conflict with my groupmates in class. At that time, I was incredibly angry that I even wanted to quit the group. I decided to take the subway home in the afternoon because I wanted to calm down. On the way home, I saw the endless traffic and my anger gradually subsided. We should understand that there are difficult times in life. However, even if feels like there is no way forward, we can still look up at the sky and appreciate the heaven and earth. No matter what happens to us every day, just like the clouds in the sky, it will eventually dissipate. Let us face the difficulties with a calm mind. </p>
      <p>最近在某天上午和同组工作的同学发生了点小小的矛盾，当时我很生气，甚至想直接退出小组。于是下午乘地铁回家，想冷静一下，回家的路上看到川流不息的车辆，心情逐渐平复。我们应该明白，人生难免会有身处困境的时候。但就算是前方无路可走，也依旧需要抬头仰望天空，欣赏天地。不论我们每天遇到的事情是好是坏，也会同天上的云一样，终会散去，让我们保持一颗平静的心态去面对困境吧。</p></td>
